# 1. Create an inventory called inventory as per the following specification.

a. Create a hostgroup called webservers with 2 host.
i. web1.example.com
ii. web2.example.com

b. Create a hostgroup called appservers with 2 host.
i. host1.example.com
ii. host2.example.com

c. Create a nested group called servers which include both groups webservers and appservers

```
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[appservers]
host1.example.com
host2.example.com

[servers:children]
webservers
appservers
```

# 2. Write a playbook called intranet.yml as per the following specifications.
a. Install the httpd package on webservers hostgroup.

b. Install the package postfix on appservers host group.

c. Update all servers with latest patches and bug fixes.

```

# 3. Ansible Architecture Configuration
**Ansible Control Node Configuration:**

Change IP Address as 192.168.10.1/24 and Gateway address 192.168.10.1 and hostname ansible-server.india.com
```
vim /etc/hostname (To verify hostname)
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.10.1 ansible-server.india.com ansible-server
192.168.10.2 node1.india.com node1
192.168.10.3 node2.india.com node2
```

**Ansible Node1 Configuration:**

Change IP Address as 192.168.10.2/24 and Gateway address 192.168.10.1 and hostname node1.india.com
```
vim /etc/hostname (To verify hostname)
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.10.1 ansible-server.india.com ansible-server
192.168.10.2 node1.india.com node1
192.168.10.3 node2.india.com node2
```

**Ansible Node2 Configuration:**

Change IP Address as 192.168.10.3/24 and Gateway address 192.168.10.1 and hostname node2.india.com
```
vim /etc/hostname (To verify hostname)
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.10.1 ansible-server.india.com ansible-server
192.168.10.2 node1.india.com node1
192.168.10.3 node2.india.com node2
```
**Ansible Server Configuration**

yum repository configuration
```
yum install ansible-core -y
ansible --version
(/usr/lin/python3.9/site-packages/ansible stores ansible modules)
useradd teacher (For 2 nodes also)
passwd teacher (For 2 nodes also)
su - teacher
mkdir inventory
cd inventory/
vim nodes
[dev]
192.168.10.2
192.168.10.3
:wq!
ansible all --list-hosts -i ~/inventory/ (to see particular 2 group replace all with dev:data)
```

# 4. Make Custom inventory file as default inventory file:
```
ansible --version (To see default inventory file)
vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
[defaults]
inventory = /home/teacher/inventory
host_key_checking = False
:wq
su - teacher
ansible all --list-hosts (To check)
```

# 5. Remote Login
## SSH Password Based Authentication: (Delete the custom inventory file)
SH key-based authentication is the recommended approach for Industry.
```
sudo yum install -y sshpass
su - teacher
rm -rf ~/inventory
mkdir ~/inventory
cd ~/inventory
vim nodes
[dev]
node1
node2
vim ~/ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = /home/teacher/inventory/nodes
host_key_checking = false
ansible all --list-hosts (Test if two nodes appear)
```

On Nodes:
```
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
PasswordAuthentication yes
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

On Server:
```
ansible dev -m ping -k
```

## SSH Passwordless Authentication
```
sudo useradd ansible
sudo passwd ansible
echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWORD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible (Give it passwordless sudo)
cat /etc/sudoers.d/ansible (Verify)
su - ansible
ssh-keygen
```
On Both Managed Nodes:
```
sudo useradd ansible
sudo passwd ansible
echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible (Optional)
```
On Server
```
ssh-copy-id ansible@node1
ssh-copy-id ansible@node2
ssh ansible@node1
ssh ansible@node2
```

## Inventory-Based Authentication 
You **store the SSH username and password in the Ansible inventory file** instead of using SSH keys (passwordless authentication). When Ansible connects to a managed node, it reads the credentials from the inventory and logs in using SSH.
```
mkdir automation
cd automation
vim ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory  (Uses the local inventory file by default) 
host_key_checking = false (Disables SSH host key verification)
remote_user = ansible (Uses the ansible user to connect by default)
ask_pass = false (Does not prompt for an SSH password)

[privilege_escalation]
become = true (Automatically uses sudo)
become_method = sudo (Runs tasks as the root user)
become_user = root (Runs tasks as the root user) 
become_ask_pass = false (Does not ask for the sudo password)
vim inventory
[web] 
node1 ansible_user=ansible ansible_password=ansible (**node1** The hostname or IP of the managed node, **ansible_user=ansible** SSH username, **ansible_password=ansible** SSH password)
node2 ansible_user=ansible ansible_password=ansible
ansible web -m ping or ansible web -m ping -i /home/ansible/automation/inventory Test the connection)


#
## Create a global inventory
```
cd /etc/ansible
vim hosts (To create default system wide inventory, if it exists you can run ansible web -m ping without specifying -i and inventory)
[web]
node1
node2
rm -rf inventory (Deletes the local inventory file, If /etc/ansible/hosts exists, Ansible falls back to using it)
echo "Good Afternoon" > file1.txt (Create a file)
cp -r /home/teacher/inventory /home/ansible/ (Copy an inventory)
chown -R ansible:ansible /home/ansible/inventory (Change ownership)
ansible all -i ~/inventory -m copy -a "src=/home/ansible/file1.txt dest=/tmp/file1.txt" (Copy a file to all nodes)
ansible all -m command -a "ls -l /tmp/file1.txt" (Verify if the file was really copied from the control node itself)
ansible all -m copy -a 'content="Welcome to our Ansible Class" dest=/tmp/file3.txt' (Create a file without an existing source)
```
On Both Nodes:
```
cd
mkdir test
chmod 755 test
```
On Server:
```
ansible all -m copy -a "src=file1.txt dest=/home/ansible/test/" (Copy a file into that directory)
```
